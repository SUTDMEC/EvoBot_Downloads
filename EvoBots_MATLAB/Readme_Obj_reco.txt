Obj_reco2.m works on MATLAB 2013
The wifi camera should be connected to the computer before running this program.
It needs the images 'Pipe.png' and 'exit.png' in the same directory as Obj_reco2.m
The images can be downloaded from the dropbox evobots shared folder. 
Once the m file is run, a png image figg.png is created in the same folder. View this image to 
see the program working.
